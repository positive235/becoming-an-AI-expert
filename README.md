## Study Progress Records 📅

### Nov 3, 2025 Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al.:
    - Read 2.7 Eigendecomposition ~ 2.11 The Determinant
  - Coursera Course "Introduction to DL & NNs with Keras" by IBM:
    - Finished Module 3 (Due Nov 5)

**Notes / Reflection**: 
  - Book "Deep Learning": Utilized YouTube Videos / ChatGPT as a learning tool to understand difficult concepts.
  - Coursera Course: Learned how to code to build a regression model and classification model with Keras

### Nov 4, 2025 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al.:
    - Read 2.12 Example: PCA ~ chapter 3 Probability and Information Theory - Introduction

**Notes / Reflection**: 
  - Book "Deep Learning": I have two versions of this book. A physical book and e-book. I purchased and downloaded e-book version of this book on my phone. The e-book version is very useful when I'm really busy and only have a little time to read.
